<!-- If your plugin defines device types, you can define them here.

	 Devices must specify their type (via the type attribute):

		relay (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		dimmer (ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHTEN/SET BRIGHTNESS/STATUS)
		speedcontrol (ON/OFF/SET SPEED LEVEL/SET SPEED INDEX/INCREASE/DECREASE/STATUS)
		sensor (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		thermostat
		sprinkler
		custom

	 The first six inherit states, actions and events from Indigo. You can
	 also specify your own custom actions and additional states, if needed.

	 The Device examples below specifies the a custom type and also enables
	 the energy meter properties and states for the device. Note that
	 energy meter properties can be enabled for any device type.

	 Devices must also specify a unique typeID - so, for instance, if you define
	 2 relay type devices then your plugin can distinguish between the two by
	 the typeID.

			<!-- The ConfigUI here is just an example of the type of device
			specific UI that might be needed. Here you might specify a text
			field for an IP address, a serial port popup, or other device
			specific options.

			<Field id="address" type="textfield" defaultValue="123456">
				<Label>Module Address:</Label>
			</Field>

			<!-- This hidden field forces property SupportsEnergyMeter to True
			which enables the energy meter states and UI.

			<Field type="checkbox" id="SupportsEnergyMeter" defaultValue="true" hidden="true" />

			<Field type="checkbox" id="SupportsEnergyMeterCurPower" defaultValue="true">
				<Label>Supports power load:</Label>
				<Description>Show current power load (Watts) in UI</Description>
			</Field>
		</ConfigUI>
		<States>
			<!--
			Because the device above sets the SupportsEnergyMeter property
			to true, the device will automatically inherit the states:

				accumEnergyTotal (kWh)
				curEnergyLevel (W)		- only exists SupportsEnergyMeterCurPower is True

			The plugin can specify additional custom states and custom
			actions (in Actions.xml) to modify custom states. As an example
			here, we define a new custom state, backlightBrightness, which
			is used to control the brightness of the backlit display of
			the module.
